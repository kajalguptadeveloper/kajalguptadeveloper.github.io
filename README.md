# [Colmar Academy](https://earth2travis.github.io/colmar-academy)

Capstone Project for the [Codecademy Pro](http://ssqt.co/mQfd5Cb) [Build a Website with HTML, CSS, and Github Pages](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/learn-how-to-build-websites) skill path.

Site is mobile first and adapts to larger screens (> 576px) with media queries. Attempted keeping the code simple and semantic. But am eager to hear if you have any ideas for improvement. Especially if you can eliminate `<div>` tags. ðŸ˜±

Stays close to the [specification](https://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-content/courses/freelance-1/capstone-2/colmar-academy-spec.png) but is not pixel perfect.

Fairly basic, somewhat semantic markup

- `<picture>` element changes image files based on screen size

### reset.css

Provides a clean slate and reduces browser inconsistencies. Code provided by [Eric A. Meyer](https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/) and is available in the public domain.

### styles.css

- Uses [Nunito Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Nunito+Sans?query=nunito+sans) typeface imported from from Google Fonts
